I just solved major headache that might save some other people. When I followed @waresulahammad code exactly, I was getting an error upon submission.

Under your form settings, on the phone field, for the “Attribute: Name” setting, I added “form-field-phone” so the code would work. But for some reason you cant name it that specifically.

“form-field-phone” did not work.
but anything else works like “phone-field”.

Summary:
Form Settings → Fields → Phone Number → Attribute: Name= “phone-field”

Update code to “$(‘input[name=“phone-field”]’).inputmask”
